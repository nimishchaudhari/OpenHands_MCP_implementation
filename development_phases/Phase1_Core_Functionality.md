## Task 1.5: Implement Basic Commit and PR Creation

**Objective**: Create a module that commits changes and creates pull requests on GitHub.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Implement functions to format commits with descriptive messages
- Create methods for organizing changes into coherent commits
- Implement PR creation with appropriate titles and descriptions
- Design templating for PR descriptions that link back to original issues
- Create functions to handle the GitHub PR API interactions

**Technical Details**:
- Commit messages should follow project conventions and include issue references
- Change organization should group related files and ensure atomic commits
- PR titles should be concise and descriptive of the solution
- PR description templates should include issue context, solution approach, and testing steps
- API interactions should handle rate limiting and error conditions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Commit messages are descriptive and follow project conventions
- Changes are organized logically in coherent commits
- PRs have appropriate titles that reflect the solution
- PR descriptions contain all necessary information and link to original issues
- System successfully manages GitHub API interactions including error handling

## Task 1.6: Implement Basic Configuration Module

**Objective**: Create a module that manages essential system settings and customizations.
