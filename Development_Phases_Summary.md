# OpenHands Resolver MCP: Development Phases Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the four development phases for implementing the OpenHands Resolver as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the Claude Desktop environment.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)

**Duration**: Approximately 4 weeks

**Objective**: Implement the essential components needed for a Minimum Viable Product that can detect triggers, interact with GitHub, set up tasks for AI agents, generate and validate code, create commits and pull requests, and handle basic configuration.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Trigger Detection Module that responds to user commands
- GitHub API Integration Module for basic repository interactions
- OpenHands Task Setup Module to configure AI tasks
- Basic Code Generation and Validation Module using Claude
- Basic Commit and PR Creation Module for GitHub submissions
- Configuration Module for system settings
- Core Integration Tests

**Expected Outcome**: A functional system that can resolve simple GitHub issues end-to-end.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Reliability and User Experience

**Duration**: Approximately 5 weeks

**Objective**: Improve the reliability, security, and user experience of the system by implementing comprehensive context gathering, error handling, bidirectional feedback, security framework, and basic metrics.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive Context Gathering Module for enhanced understanding
- Error Handling and Recovery Module for robust operation
- Enhanced Feedback and Visualization Module for user interaction
- Security Framework Module for secure credential handling
- Basic Metrics and Analytics Module for performance tracking
- Enhancements to Phase 1 modules
- Enhanced Integration Tests

**Expected Outcome**: A more robust and user-friendly system that can handle a wider range of issues and provides better feedback.

## Phase 3: Advanced Resolution Capabilities

**Duration**: Approximately 6 weeks

**Objective**: Implement sophisticated capabilities that significantly enhance the system's ability to handle complex issues, including dependency analysis, comprehensive testing, documentation synchronization, and intelligent model orchestration.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Dependency Analysis Module for understanding code relationships
- Comprehensive Testing Framework for solution validation

- Model Orchestration Layer for efficient AI coordination
- Explanation Generation Capability for solution justification
- Contextual Prompting System for optimized AI interactions
- Advanced Integration Tests

**Expected Outcome**: A sophisticated system capable of resolving complex issues with high-quality solutions and comprehensive explanations.

## Phase 4: Optimization and Ecosystem Integration

**Duration**: Approximately 7 weeks

**Objective**: Optimize the system and integrate it with the broader development ecosystem, implementing advanced version control, adaptive learning, ecosystem connections, resource optimization, and multi-repository resolution.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Advanced Version Control Integration for sophisticated Git operations
- Adaptive Learning Mechanisms for system improvement over time
- Ecosystem Integration Capabilities for connecting with dev tools
- Resource Optimization Module for efficient operation
- Multi-Repository Resolution capabilities for cross-repo issues
- Cross-Language Analysis Capability for polyglot projects
- Final Integration Tests

**Expected Outcome**: A highly optimized, adaptable system that integrates seamlessly with development workflows and efficiently handles complex, cross-repository issues.

## Total Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 5 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 6 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 7 weeks

**Total Duration**: Approximately 22 weeks (5.5 months)
